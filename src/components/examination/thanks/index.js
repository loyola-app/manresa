        <Paragraph>
            Examen is prayer and every prayer we make through Jesus Christ; cut off from Him we can do nothing. The
            stronger my faith the greater my sense of emptiness and of God’s goodness. Gratitude for God’s love-in-deeds
            was a powerful element in the life of St Ignatius. I can remember the sweep of the Exercises and savour my
            last retreat. I can be thankful: For the covenant: God’s irrevocable gift of Himself to me in Christ; His
            gift of everyone as a brother and sister. For myself: chosen with these qualities and failings in Christ.
            For everything: even the harsh and painful aspects of life which lead me to the Father through the Cross and
            Resurrection of His Son. Thanksgiving will help me to discover God’s daily gifts and gradually to recognize
            that all is gift: What have I got to be grateful for today ? How much do I take for granted ? What has made
            me ungrateful, dissatisfied, frustrated? Am I becoming more grateful and contented?
