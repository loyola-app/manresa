            Too much attention to our own victories and failures can make us self-absorbed and confirm us in the
            illusion that we manage our own lives. Examination is rather a question of asking how I respond to God’s
            loving action in my life: How was I drawn to God today: a friend, an event, a book, the beauty of nature ?
            Have I learnt anything about God and His ways: in ordinary occasions, spare moments ? Did I meet Him in:
            fears, joys, work, misunderstandings, weariness, suffering ? Did His Word come alive in: prayer, scriptures,
            liturgy ? Did I bring Christ to my community ? Did they bring Christ to me ? Have I been a sign of God’s
            presence and love to the people I met today ? Did I go out to: the lonely, the sorrowful, the discouraged,
            the needy ? Was I aware of God’s work in my own locality, my country, in other nations of the world, in the
            Church at large ? Have I had a keener sense of being loved, of sinfulness, of desire to give back what I
            have received, of dependence ? Is there some part of my life still untouched by Jesus Christ and where He is
            calling me to a change of heart ?{' '}
