            ‘The Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in my name will teach you everything.’ (John 14:26) Only the Holy
            Spirit can help me to know myself as a son/daughter of the Father and a companion of Jesus. I need to have
            my eyes opened: I need light to see whether my gratitude is in proportion to the worth of so many gifts. The
            Holy Spirit teaches me each day about Christ, about my life in Christ and about my use and acceptance of
            gifts. The gifts of the Holy Spirit are: love, joy, peace patience, kindness, goodness, trustfulness,
            gentleness and self-control (Gal.5:2).{' '}
