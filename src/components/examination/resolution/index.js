            Gifts in the past and gifts in the future; all the meetings and events of the next few hours will be full of
            gifts and full of their Giver. How do I face the future ? With apathy, distaste, fear, despondency ? Which
            parts of my life particularly call for the Lordâ€™s healing and protection ? The more I trust in God and allow
            Him to lead me the more I experience hope in Him, who raises me up from weakness, poverty and pain to the
            joy of His Resurrection.
