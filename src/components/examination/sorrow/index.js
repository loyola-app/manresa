            A true awareness of my sinfulness is still a gift granted in love by the Father, the Son and the Holy
            Spirit. I can express sorrow for the ways in which I have failed to respond to His love at work in me. This
            can lead to: Wonder at constantly being brought home. Joy and gratitude because I share in the victory of
            Christ. Mistrust of self and trust in God. Serene acceptance of my weakness. Conviction that I am being
            converted from a sinner into a son/daughter of God.{' '}
